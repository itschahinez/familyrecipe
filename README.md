# Family Recipe

This mobile app allows food lovers to share their recipes with circles of friends or family members. Thanks to this community, people can:

- add their own recipes in the app
- share them with a circle of friends
- exchange tips or compliments by writing comments
- find recipes by ingredient among their own recipes and the ones that have been shared with them
- find new recipes ideas by ingredient thanks to an API
- video call their friends to cook all together

To make this app, we used:
- CRUD
- nested forms
- an API called Spoonacular to get recipe ideas by ingredient
- a gem called stimulus-autocomplete to implement an autocomplete functionality on the recipe search bar
- a Stimulus controller to trigger the search when an autocomplete option is selected
- a video call API called Daily

Feel free to try it here: https://www.familyrecipe.live/  
Please note the app has been coded for iPhone 12 Pro, and there is a daily limit on the number of recipe idea searches that can be done on the "Find inspiration" page with the Spoonacular API.
